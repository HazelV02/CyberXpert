Developed an expert system that combines artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to automate vulnerability detection, security analysis, and reporting. The system allows users to perform network and device security tests, analyze results using AI-driven techniques, and create detailed reports with specific recommendations. It includes a dynamic vulnerability database that updates automatically, a smart chatbot assistant that offers real-time cybersecurity support based on test results, and a role-based structure to manage administrative and developer permissions. By merging AI with penetration testing and threat analysis, the project improves the efficiency of cybersecurity professionals, lowers manual effort, and strengthens the overall security of targeted systems.
